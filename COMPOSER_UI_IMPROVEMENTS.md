# Composer UI Improvements

## Overview
Made significant improvements to the Gmail composer interface to streamline the workflow and prevent UI issues with large datasets.

## Key Changes

### 1. Simplified Composer Toolbar
**Before**: 8+ buttons cluttering the composer
**After**: Only 2 essential buttons

#### Removed from Composer:
- ❌ Bulk Operations button
- ❌ Calendar button
- ❌ Analytics button
- ❌ Recipient Picker button
- ❌ CSV Import button
- ❌ Templates button
- ❌ Tracking Toggle button

#### Kept in Composer (Essential Only):
- ✅ **Schedule** button - For scheduling emails
- ✅ **Bulk Send** button - For bulk email sending

**Result**: Clean, focused composer interface without clutter

### 2. Sheets Preview as Popup
**Problem**: Loading sheets with 1000s of recipients made the composer extremely long
**Solution**: Sheets preview now opens in a dedicated popup/modal

#### New Popup Features:
- **Dedicated Modal**: Beautiful popup overlay
- **Success Summary**: Clear status with recipient count
- **Column Display**: Shows all available columns as badges
- **Variable Guide**: Instructions on using variables
- **Data Preview**: First 5 rows in a scrollable table
- **Scrollable**: Max height with smooth scrolling
- **Backdrop Blur**: Modern glassmorphic effect
- **Compact Composer**: No longer stretches or becomes unmanageable

#### Benefits:
✅ Composer stays compact regardless of sheet size
✅ Professional popup for data preview
✅ Better user experience with large datasets
✅ All information accessible without scrolling composer
✅ Focused workflow

### 3. UI Enhancements in Popup
- **Modern Design**: Rounded corners, gradients, shadows
- **Color Coding**: Success (green), info (blue), data (gray)
- **Responsive Layout**: Adapts to content
- **Table Design**: Professional striped table
- **Easy Close**: Click outside or close button

## Workflow Improvement

### Before:
1. Click Bulk Send
2. Enter sheet URL
3. Preview expands in composer (becomes 1000+ lines long!)
4. Scroll to find other options
5. Difficult to compose email

### After:
1. Click Bulk Send
2. Enter sheet URL
3. **Popup opens** showing preview
4. Close popup when done reviewing
5. Composer stays compact
6. Proceed with sending
