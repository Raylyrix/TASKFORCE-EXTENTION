# Modal Overlay Approach for Bulk Send

## Problem
Integrated panel inside Gmail compose window is not clickable - buttons, inputs, and dropdowns don't respond to user interaction despite multiple CSS and JavaScript fixes.

## Root Cause
Gmail's complex DOM structure and event handling system is intercepting events before they reach our injected panel elements.

## Solution
**Switch from integrated panel to modal overlay**
- Modal appears as a popup ON TOP of Gmail (not inside it)
- Higher z-index (999999) ensures it's above everything
- Fixed positioning means Gmail can't interfere with layout
- Standalone event handlers work independently

## Implementation

### Modal Structure:
```
<div class="aem-bulk-modal-overlay">  <!-- Full screen backdrop -->
  <div>  <!-- Modal content -->
    - Close button
    - Sheets URL input
    - Delay dropdown
    - Start time input
    - Conditional options
    - Load & Send buttons
  </div>
</div>
```

### Key Features:
1. **Click outside to close** - Backdrop click removes modal
2. **Close button** - X in top right
3. **Reads from Gmail** - Gets subject and body from compose window
4. **Writes to Gmail** - Send button triggers bulk send with Gmail's content

## Result

✅ **All elements clickable** - Modal is isolated from Gmail's DOM  
✅ **Clean UI** - Focused popup experience  
✅ **Height fixed** - No elongation issues (panel removed)  
✅ **Event handling works** - Independent event system

**Status**: ✅ Modal Overlay Approach  
**Advantage**: Complete separation from Gmail's interference
