---

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. ✅ Continuous Backend Health Monitoring
- **Checks every 30 seconds** if backend is online/offline
- **Real-time status updates** stored in extension
- **Status changes tracked** and logged

### 2. ✅ Smart User Notifications

#### When Backend is READY:
🎉 **"You can turn off your PC and go enjoy! Emails will send automatically."**
- Popup opens automatically
- Green success notification
- Peace of mind for users

#### When Backend is OFFLINE:
⚠️ **"Backend offline - Please DO NOT close or turn off your PC! Emails will only send with browser open."**
- Warning notification

- Clear instructions

#### When Backend COMES ONLINE During Bulk Send:
🚀 **"Backend is now ready! The remaining X/Y emails will send automatically. You can turn off your PC now!"**
- Automatic popup

- Seamless transition

### 3. ✅ Hybrid Email Routing

#### Single Email Scheduling:
```
User clicks Send
     ↓
Check backend status
     ↓
Backend Ready? → Send to backend → ✅ "Go enjoy!"
Backend Offline? → Store locally → ⚠️ "Keep PC on"
```

#### Bulk Send:
```
User starts bulk send
     ↓
Check backend status
     ↓
Backend Ready? → Schedule all on backend → ✅ "Go enjoy!"
Backend Offline? → Start locally + monitor
     ↓
Monitor every 10 seconds
     ↓
Backend comes online? → Migrate remaining → ✅ "PC off now!"
     ↓
Show: "Remaining X/Y emails will send"
```

### 4. ✅ Automatic Migration

When backend comes online:
- **Pending emails** migrated automatically
- **Active bulk sends** can migrate mid-campaign
- **Zero user intervention** required
- **Seamless transition** from local to backend

### 5. ✅ Intelligent Fallback

If backend fails:
- **Immediately switch** to local storage
- **Continue sending** without interruption
- **No lost emails**
- **User stays informed**

## 📊 System Architecture

### Health Monitoring System
```javascript
// Continuous monitoring (every 30 seconds)
setInterval(() => {
  checkBackendHealth() → Update status
  If status changed → Notify user
}, 30000)
```

### Status States
- **'ready'** - Backend operational, use it!
- **'offline'** - Backend down, use local
- **'checking'** - Currently testing connection
- **'unknown'** - Initial state

### Email Storage Strategy

#### Backend Storage (When Ready):
- PostgreSQL database
- Scheduled via cron
- Sends 24/7
- PC can be off

#### Local Storage (When Offline):
- Chrome storage API
- Chrome alarms
- Sends when browser open
- PC must stay on
