# UI Consolidation Progress

## Updates Made

### âœ… Follow-Up Improvements Started
Added day-specific scheduling and multiple follow-up options to the follow-up creation modal:
- Day-of-week selection (Mon-Sun checkboxes)
- Number of follow-ups in sequence (1-5)
- Better visual layout
- Improved tooltips

## Remaining Tasks

Due to the large scope and interconnected nature of the content.js file (3913 lines), I need to clarify the approach:

### Questions for User:

1. **Single-Page UI Consolidation**: 
   - The Track & Engage tab currently shows Campaign Progress, Replies, and Follow-ups in sections
   - Do you want these as collapsible sections within the same page, or tabs within the tab?

2. **Composer Buttons Alignment**:
   - Currently Schedule and Bulk Send buttons are added vertically
   - Should they be in a horizontal row next to Gmail's existing buttons?

3. **Feature Integration**:
   - Some features (like analytics, templates) open separate modals by design
   - Should ALL features be inline in the tab, or keep modals for complex forms?

Please clarify so I can implement exactly what you want!
