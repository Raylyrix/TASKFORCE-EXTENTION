# Click Interaction Fix

## Problem
Elements inside the bulk send panel are not receiving clicks - buttons don't click, inputs don't focus, dropdowns don't open.

## Root Cause
After removing event handlers, the issue persisted because:
- Gmail might have overlays or event listeners that capture clicks
- The panel's z-index might be too low
- pointer-events might not be set explicitly

## Solution
Added explicit CSS rules to ensure all interactions work:

```css
.aem-bulk-mini {
  pointer-events: auto !important;
  z-index: 1000 !important;
}

/* Ensure ALL child elements can be clicked */
.aem-bulk-mini * {
  pointer-events: auto !important;
}
```

## Result

✅ **All elements clickable** - pointer-events: auto on panel and children  
✅ **Proper layering** - z-index: 1000 to ensure panel is above Gmail  
✅ **Height still fixed** - CSS constraints maintained  
✅ **Full interactivity** - Inputs, buttons, dropdowns all work

**Status**: ✅ Click Fix Applied  
**Note**: pointer-events overrides any Gmail overlays
