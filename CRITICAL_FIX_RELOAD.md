# ⚠️ CRITICAL: Extension Needs Reload

## The Problem

Your extension is still using the **OLD cached client ID** because it hasn't been reloaded yet.

## ✅ IMMEDIATE FIX

### Step 1: Reload Extension

1. Go to: `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find: **"TaskForce Email Manager"**
3. Click the **🔄 RELOAD BUTTON** (circular arrow icon)
4. Extension will restart with new client ID

### Step 2: Test

After reloading:
1. Click extension icon
2. Try authenticating
3. Should work with new client ID! ✅

## Why This Happened

Chrome caches extension files. When we updated manifest.json, Chrome still had the old version in memory.

**Solution:** Reload the extension to load the new manifest.json file with the correct client ID.

## Expected Result

After reload:
- ✅ No more "bad client id" error
- ✅ Can authenticate successfully
- ✅ Gmail integration works

---

## Quick Command

Just press **F5** or click the reload button in `chrome://extensions/`!

**The fix is already in manifest.json - just needs to be loaded!** 🚀
