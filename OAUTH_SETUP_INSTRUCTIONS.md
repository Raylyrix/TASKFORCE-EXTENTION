# üîê OAuth Setup Instructions - CRITICAL

## ‚ö†Ô∏è You MUST Configure OAuth Properly

Your client ID exists but **needs the correct redirect URI** for Chrome extensions.

## üìã Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Extension ID

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
3. Find "TaskForce Email Manager"
4. **Copy the Extension ID** (looks like: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`)

### Step 2: Go to Google Cloud Console

1. Open: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Select project: **taskforce-mailer-v2**

### Step 3: Edit Your OAuth Client

1. Find your client ID in the list: `1007595181381-dd7o4v4jh01b1pcar6a681hj6pmjdsnp`
2. **Click on it** to edit
3. You'll see fields for:
   - Authorized JavaScript origins
   - Authorized redirect URIs

### Step 4: Add Redirect URI

In **"Authorized redirect URIs"**, click **"+ ADD URI"** and add:

```
https://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID.chromiumapp.org
```

Replace `YOUR_EXTENSION_ID` with the ID you copied in Step 1.

**Example:**
```
https://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456.chromiumapp.org
```

### Step 5: Save

1. Click **"SAVE"** at the bottom
2. Wait for changes to propagate (10-30 seconds)

### Step 6: Test Extension

1. Reload extension in `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click extension icon
3. Click "Not Connected"
4. Should now work! ‚úÖ

## üéØ Alternative: Create New OAuth Client

If you want to create a fresh one:

### Step 1: Create Credentials

1. In Google Cloud Console
2. Click **"Create Credentials"** ‚Üí **"OAuth client ID"**

### Step 2: Select Type

- Choose **"Chrome App"** for best compatibility
- OR choose **"Web application"** (you're using this)

### Step 3: Configure

**For Web Application:**
- Name: TaskForce Extension
- Authorized JavaScript origins: `https://accounts.google.com`
- Authorized redirect URIs: `https://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID.chromiumapp.org`

**For Chrome App:**
- Name: TaskForce Extension
- Application ID: Your extension ID

### Step 4: Get Credentials

1. Click **Create**
2. **Copy the Client ID**
3. Update manifest.json with new Client ID

## üîç How to Debug

### Check Current Redirect URI

1. Open popup
2. Open console (F12)
3. Look for log: `Redirect URI: https://...`

This is what you need to add to Google Cloud Console.

### Still Not Working?

**Check:**
1. Did you reload extension after changing?
2. Did you wait 30 seconds after saving OAuth settings?
3. Is redirect URI exactly matching (including https://)?

**Common Issues:**
- Trailing slash mismatch
- Wrong extension ID
- Changes haven't propagated yet

## üö® IMPORTANT

**Chrome extensions MUST have the redirect URI configured in Google Cloud Console!**

Without it, you'll always get "bad client id" error.

The redirect URI format is:
```
https://[EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org
```

Where `[EXTENSION_ID]` is your actual extension ID from chrome://extensions/

3. Make sure Gmail API is enabled
4. Ensure you're logged into Google Cloud Console with same account
