# 🔄 Extension Context Invalidated - Fix

## The Error

```
Error: Extension context invalidated
```

## What Happened

You reloaded the extension in `chrome://extensions/` while Gmail was open. The content script running on Gmail lost connection to the extension's background script.

## ✅ Simple Fix

Just reload the Gmail page!

1. Press **F5** on Gmail
2. OR click the reload button
3. Extension will reconnect automatically

## Why This Happens

When you:
1. Load extension → Gmail page uses content script
2. Modify extension files
3. Reload extension in chrome://extensions/
4. Content script on Gmail tries to talk to background script
5. Background script is gone (reloading)
6. Error: "Extension context invalidated"

## ✅ Best Practice

### When Developing:
1. Make your code changes
2. Save files
3. Go to Gmail
4. **Reload Gmail page (F5)**
5. Test features

This reloads the content script with new code!

### When Using:
1. Extension is loaded
2. Just use Gmail normally
3. No need to reload anything

## What I Fixed

Added better error handling in the code:
- Detects when extension context is invalid
- Shows helpful error messages
- Guides user to reload page

## Quick Steps

1. ✅ Code is updated
2. ❌ Gmail page is outdated
3. ✅ Just reload Gmail (F5)
4. ✅ Everything works!

## Summary

**The error means the Gmail page is using an old version of the content script.** Just reload the Gmail page and it will work! 🚀
