# üîê Complete OAuth Solution - Chrome Extension

## The Real Problem

Chrome extensions use a **special redirect URI format** that MUST be added to your OAuth client.

## ‚úÖ CORRECT SOLUTION

### Step 1: Get Your Extension ID

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Find "TaskForce Email Manager"
3. Copy the Extension ID (looks like: `abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`)

### Step 2: Add Redirect URI to OAuth Client

**For WEB APPLICATION** (what you have):
1. Go to Google Cloud Console: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Click on your OAuth client ID
3. In **"Authorized redirect URIs"** section
4. Click **"+ ADD URI"**
5. Add this exact format:

```
https://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID.chromiumapp.org/
```

Replace `YOUR_EXTENSION_ID` with your actual extension ID from Step 1.

**Example:**
```
https://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456.chromiumapp.org/
```

### Step 3: Save and Wait

1. Click **SAVE**
2. Wait **30 seconds** for changes to propagate
3. Important: Changes take time to propagate!

### Step 4: Reload Extension

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click **RELOAD** on your extension
3. Try authenticating again

## Alternative: Create Chrome App OAuth Client

If web application doesn't work, create a dedicated Chrome App client:

1. In Google Cloud Console
2. **Create Credentials** ‚Üí **OAuth client ID**
3. Select **"Chrome App"** (NOT Web application!)
4. Enter your **Extension ID**
5. Click **Create**
6. Copy the new Client ID
7. Update manifest.json with new ID

---

## Why Redirect URI is Required

Chrome extensions use a special redirect URI pattern:
```
https://[EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org/
```

This is how Chrome knows to redirect OAuth back to your extension.

**Without this redirect URI, Google rejects the authentication with "bad client id" error.**

---

## Debugging Steps

### 1. Verify Extension ID
```javascript
// In popup.js console, run:
chrome.identity.getRedirectURL()
```
This will show you the exact redirect URI your extension uses.

### 2. Verify in Google Cloud Console
- Go to your OAuth client
- Check "Authorized redirect URIs"
- Make sure the chromiumapp.org URI is there
- Make sure it matches exactly (including trailing slash)

### 3. Check Propagation
- OAuth changes can take up to 5 minutes to propagate
- Try waiting and reloading again

## Quick Checklist

- [ ] Got Extension ID from chrome://extensions/
- [ ] Added redirect URI to OAuth client in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Format: `https://EXTENSION_ID.chromiumapp.org/`
- [ ] Saved changes in Google Cloud Console
- [ ] Waited 30 seconds
- [ ] Reloaded extension in chrome://extensions/
- [ ] Tried authenticating again

---

## Expected Result

After completing these steps:
‚úÖ No "bad client id" error
‚úÖ OAuth flow completes successfully
‚úÖ Can authenticate with Gmail
‚úÖ Extension works as expected

---

## Still Not Working?

If still getting "bad client id" error after adding redirect URI:

1. **Double-check the redirect URI** - must match exactly
2. **Check if Gmail API is enabled** in Google Cloud Console
3. **Try creating a new Chrome App OAuth client** instead
4. **Wait longer** - sometimes takes 5+ minutes to propagate

---

## Key Point

**You CAN use a Web Application OAuth client for Chrome extensions!**

Just need to add the special redirect URI:
```
https://[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org/
```

This is the standard way to use OAuth with Chrome extensions!
