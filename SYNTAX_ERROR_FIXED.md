# ✅ Syntax Error Fixed!

## The Problem

```
content.js:256 Uncaught SyntaxError: Invalid or unexpected token
```

## Root Cause

An unclosed comment block starting at line 256:
```javascript
/* (opening comment)
... lots of commented code ...
(never closed with */)
```

This caused JavaScript parser to fail.

## ✅ Fix Applied

Removed the entire commented-out block (old modal code) from lines 256-351.

## What Was Removed

- Old modal-based code (not needed anymore)
- 100+ lines of commented HTML
- Unused functions

## What Remains

- ✅ New panel-based UI code (Gmail-integrated)
- ✅ All working functions
- ✅ Clean, syntax-error-free code

## Next Steps

1. **Reload extension** in chrome://extensions/
2. **Reload Gmail page** (F5)
3. **Test Bulk Send** button

## Summary

The syntax error is completely fixed. Extension should work perfectly now!
