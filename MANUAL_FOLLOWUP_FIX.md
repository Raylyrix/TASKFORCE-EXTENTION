# ✅ Manual Follow-up Fix - Complete!

## 🐛 Problem Fixed

**Error:** "Failed to send follow-up: Unknown error"

**Root Cause:** The background script (`background.js`) didn't have a handler for the `sendManualFollowUp` action.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. Added Message Handler
Added handler in `background.js` for the `sendManualFollowUp` action:

```javascript
if (request.action === 'sendManualFollowUp') {
  sendManualFollowUpEmail(request.email, request.subject, request.message).then(() => {
    sendResponse({ success: true });
  }).catch((error) => {
    sendResponse({ success: false, error: error.message });
  });
  return true;
}
```

### 2. Created `sendManualFollowUpEmail` Function

**Features:**
- ✅ Checks daily sending limit
- ✅ Validates authentication
- ✅ Sends via Gmail API
- ✅ Tracks email for reply detection
- ✅ Updates statistics
- ✅ Increments follow-ups sent counter
- ✅ Error handling with detailed messages

**What it does:**
1. Validates daily limit
2. Gets OAuth token
3. Sends email via Gmail API
4. Stores email in `emailReplies` for tracking
5. Increments `sentToday` counter
6. Increments `followUpsSent` counter
7. Returns success/error response

## 🎯 How It Works Now

### User Flow:
1. User clicks "Send Follow-up" on any email
2. Composer modal opens
3. User edits subject/message if needed
4. User clicks "Send Follow-up"
5. Message sent to background script
6. Background script handles sending
7. Success message shown

### Background Flow:
```
content.js → chrome.runtime.sendMessage()
           ↓
background.js → sendManualFollowUpEmail()
              ↓
           Gmail API → Send email
              ↓
         Track in storage
              ↓
        Update statistics
              ↓
        Return response
```

  subject: followup_subject,
  body: followup_message,
  sentAt: ISO_timestamp,
